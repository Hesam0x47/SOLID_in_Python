# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five SOLID principles, which aim to create more maintainable and flexible software designs. Let's break down its key points and practical implications:
## Formal Definition
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

    - **High-level modules:** Represent the business logic or core functionality of your application.
    - **Low-level modules:** Represent the implementation details, such as database interactions, APIs, or specific libraries.
    - By depending on abstractions, you decouple the high-level logic from implementation specifics. This allows for easier changes and testing.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Instead, details should depend on abstractions.
    - This means that concrete implementations (details) should adhere to abstract contracts, like interfaces or abstract classes.
    - The design remains resilient to change because altering implementation details won't ripple through the system as long as the abstraction remains stable.
